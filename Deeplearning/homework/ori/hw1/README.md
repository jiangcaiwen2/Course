Before you start coding, make sure you current work dir is in this folder `PartB-coding`, otherwise you can not import the modules normally.

The submission poses no difference against a normal push to the github repo. We will assemble your assignments via Git Classroom's functionality. 
You need to push this folder contains both PartA and PartB into you Github repo which is created by Git Classroom. **We will take your last commit as the final result.**
